# Superformula Mobile Developer Coding Test

Make sure you read **all** of this document carefully, and follow the guidelines in it.

## Requirements

There is only one test here currently, please review and get back to us.

## What We Are Looking For

Use any libraries that you would normally use if this were a real production App. Please note: we're interested in your code & the way you solve the problem, not how well you can use a particular library or feature.

_We're interested in your method and how you approach the problem just as much as we're interested in the end result._

Here's what you should strive for:

- Good use of structure, security, and performance best practices.
- Solid testing approach.
- Extensible code.

## Q&A

> Where should I send back the result when I'm done?

Fork this repo and send us a pull request when you think you are done. There is no deadline for this task unless otherwise noted to you directly.

> What if I have a question?

Just create a new issue in this repo and we will respond and get back to you quickly.

> What Flutter version should I use?

Use the latest Stable flutter version at the time you are starting this challenge.
